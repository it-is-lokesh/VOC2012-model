# Training VOC 2012 Dataset

This project is an attempt to understand how the model architecture is affecting the accuracy of the model. I have made all the documentation clear to let the learners get a better intuition on CNNs.

The dataset is a collection of 17125 images divided into 20 classes. 
The results and discussion for each training model have been included in the "model_checkpoints" folder according to the date it was being trained. Hope this documentation helps you get a clear idea of how to work on Computer Vision projects. Comments are welcomed :)

Note: The folder naming format in the model_checkpoints forder is MM_DD_YY.

### Important Results concluded
- We have run the iterations with and without using dropout, and noticed that the accuracy gets saturated
